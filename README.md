**Rutgers Fintech Bootcamp:  _Homework #1 Fintech Case Study_**

## Overview and Origin

The topic of this case study will be BQAUNT, a solution develped and delivered by Bloomberg, LP, a global fintech company founded by Michael Bloomberg in 1981.  The goal of this case study will be to inform the reader about the BQUANT solution by offering an overview of the genesis of the solution, its underlying technologies, use cases, industry reception, competitors, and potential opportunities and challenges users may discover in the future.
 
 Bloomberg LP is currently one of the largest fintech companies in the world.  The Bloomberg Terminal comprises a desktop interface delivering a myriad of data, information, and applications.  The Bloomberg Terminal is accessed by over by over 300,000 professionals drawn largely from, but not limited to, the financial services industry.

 BQUANT was was launched as an application on the Bloomberg Terminal in 2013.  An Enterprise version was launched in September of 2022, and the author will seek further details as they become available in news and journal articles.    

 BQUANT is funded by Bloomberg LP (a private company exceeding $10B in annual revenues) and therefore ultimately by its owner, Michael Bloomberg.  The author was unable to uncover outside funding sources which are unlikely due the company being private.

## Business Activities

BQUANT is an application designed to help financial and other institutions derive and test a variety of insights within a flexible, scalable solution whose capabilities exceed the limits of MATLAB to deal with large data and financial calculations.

The idea for BQUANT came to minds of the Bloomberg Desktop Build Group.  In the 2000s, this group was focused on helping clients model and work with an Excel API which came to be included with the overall desktop offering.  With the desktop API, clients could retrieve data, but not efficiently as data size grew and MatLab's capabilities were exceeeded.  According to the Head of Bloomberg Quant Research, Bruno Dupire,  
>"We realized we had the tools and knowledge to build our own rich computational environment that could be used to explore financial analyses in multiple dimensions, simultaneously.”



BQUANT is specifically designed for users whose roles include: Quantitative Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Financial Engineer, as well as, Portfolio Managers and Financial Analysts who possess varying degrees of programming proficiency.  Interestingly, BQUANT offers a "retail" view of outputs which removes the coding elements, making information and insights available to more user roles. 

BQUANT offers a very distinct advantage in terms of the applicable areas users may help enhance the investment management of a comprehensive range of securities, strategies, porfolios, indices, derivatives, and other financial instruments.  

BQUANT is uniquely positioned in the industry as the application may only be accessed through the Bloomberg Terminal.  Few other fintech providers may lay claim even close to the number of unique users than Bloomberg may of the Bloomberg Terminal.  From that number of competitors even less may claim the as much user attention and performance of mission critical functions throughout and across the front, middle, and back office operations of the smallest hedge funds to the largest global asset managers.

Bloomberg is also an aggreator, normalizer, and vendor of hundreds of data points and sets required to manage virtually any kind of capital.  Bloomberg data is commercialized through desktop and feeds distribution. Bloomberg Terminal users, and therefore BQUANT Terminal application users enjoy access to one of, if not, the most comprehensive and complete financial data databases in the world.  

BQUANT technology comprises a number of unique foundations and features.  BQUANT uses an in-house developed query language called Bloomberg Query Language (BQL), a Bloomberg specific extension of the D3.js visualization libary, and bindings to Python and .NET.  Additionally, BQUANT users are able to utilize Jupyter notebooks thanks to a 2014 decision to link BQUANT to the open source iPython group.  

## Landscape
Bloomberg LP is squarely centered within the financial data and technology domain.  Bloomberg provides clients with a one-stop desktop portal designed to deliver critical information to users with differing roles throughout financial services companies.

BQUANT is an application on the Bloomberg Terminal designed to support and augment the unique scale and processing of large data and diverse data sets often including substantial amounts of historical data (for backtesting purposes).

According to the *Journal of Big Data*,  
>"Big data is one of the most recent business and technical issues in the age of technology. Hundreds of millions of events occur every day. The financial field is deeply involved in the calculation of big data events. As a result, hundreds of millions of financial transactions occur in the financial world each day. Therefore, financial practitioners and analysts consider it an emerging issue of the data management and analytics of different financial products and services. Also, big data has significant impacts on financial products and services."  

One may conclude that the amount of data created and consumed by the financial sector and service companies will continue to expand.  BQUANT offers users a compelling combination of a diverse pool of data, a scalable platform, and powerful tools useful to the quantitative professional.  Ideas and strategies may be tested quicky in a format familiar to data scientists, and results may be displayed both quantitatively as well as graphically (for the non-progammatically inclined consumer).  

BQUANT faces still competition from other large and recognized data and technology vendors.  According to *g2.com*, competitors to BQUANT include Alphasense, Sentieo, S&P Capital IQ and Workbench, and Factset Research Management among others.  

According to at least one client testimonial, BQUANT is a winner for the reason that the Bloomberg data is familiar and trusted.  BQUANT is a favorable ennvirnment with users may access large amounts of normalized data and share and analyze the results with up and downstream consumer making financial invesment decisions. 

The impact of BQUANT on Bloomberg's overall core business selling Terminals is very positive.  As noted by one client above, BQUANT essentially unlocks the power of an immense internal database of financal information with new, more modern, and fit for the purpose of large backtesting and strategies testing.  Users demand for data had been bottlenecked by the capacity issues of .xls API and MatLab.

BQuant's status among the competition is clouded somewhat by the fact that Bloomberg LP is a private company.  With its base of over 300,000 Bloomberg Terminal users, competitors face a stiff battle in the war to capture the eyes, minds, and use cases of tomorrow's big data world.

## Recommendations ##

The author recommends that Bloomberg recognize that one of its greatest strengths is potentially one of its greatest weaknesses in disguise.  BQUANT is touted as an open and content agnostic environment where users may enjoy the capacity and scaling BQUANT tools boast.  However, BQUANT is not as "open" as it may appear considering its capabilities and associations with iPython and Jupyter notebooks.  

For example, Bloomberg Query Language (BQL), according to at least two sources (who wish to remain anonymous), working at large North American asset managers, is not at all "open" and often hard in circumstances to run effectively.  And it will remain to be seen if Bloomberg can enclose and capture the monetary rewards of providing such services within a closed system.  Essentially, Bloomberg is the largest of the competitors and will aim to maintain that position by holding its users close.  Even with all of the tools familiar to those in data science community, there may not be enough to hold users who may wish for greater openness and content agnosticism.  

In fact, BQUANT's claim to offer integration with other datasets may hit a firewill should other large vendors of data choose to pursue a strategy of charging clients a (high) premium to use that vendor's data in BQUANT.  Furthermore, some larger data companies may choose to preclude the use of their data within BQUANT out of concern that Bloomberg may have an ufair or uncompetitive view into the vendor's propriety data and/or data methodologies.  BQUANT users may have to consider very carefully how willing other data vendors compete against Bloomberg/BQUANT.
